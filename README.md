# IISER Bhopal 2025
This repository holds the codes for the workshop/presentation on "Design Principles In Biology: A Dynamical Systems Approach" at IISER Bhopal in January 2025.

We use JSim to simulate dynamical systems modelled using systems of ODEs. 
JSim could be obtained from https://www.imagwiki.nibib.nih.gov/physiome/jsim
Check the instructions on The JSim website for installation and usage.

The repository holds three models: Goodwin model 1, Goodwin model 2 and the Mutual Repressor model.
JSim project files for these models are provided. These can be loaded on JSim and used without any modifications.
The codes are also provided as text files. One can copy and use these codes and create new projects.
